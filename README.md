Everytime I try to refresh my skills with leetcode&trade; style problems I find the effort extremely demotivating at best given the extreme lack of real world applicability.

With this project I want to try to take those data structures and algorithms that I never user professionally or that are so abstracted away as to be unrecognizable and implement them to solve the problems they are best at solving.

For example, I never use Linked Lists directly or Binary Search Trees but they are fundamental to CS (and coding interviews), so why not try to understand them better by writing some weird app that actually uses them.

Also learn pythong along the way
